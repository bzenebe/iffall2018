	<b>2.</b> In a food processor put small amount of the meat at a time, spread some mitmita, grind until meat is finely chopped; using a fork, remove any residue of fat and seams; place the spicy ground meat in a dish; repeat the process until all required meat is done.

	<br><br>

	<b>3.</b> In small pot, on a lower heat melt the butter, add the remaining mitmita, false cardamom, (garlic, black pepper, salt, if needed); remove from heat.

	<br><br>

	<b>4.</b> Combine the spicy ground meat with the spicy butter; using fork and spoon, mix it until completely marinated.

	<br><br>

	<b>5.</b> Place it in a lightly warm serving dish, serve it immediately with Injera or bread. If preferred, saut√© the marinated meat for two to three minutes.

	<br><br>

	<b>6.</b> Note: As Steak Tartar is uncooked dish, choice of first class quality meat and cleanliness is important.
