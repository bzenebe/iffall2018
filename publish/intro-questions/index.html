		<li>Hi, I'm Bersabeh Zenebe and I am a junior in Communication Design, studying a minor in Computer Science.</li>
		<li>Besides this course being required for my major, I am also very interested in UX and finding ways to engage with peers through popular media.</li>
		<li>I have taken a computer science code where we used JAVA to code, and have also researched html on my own.</li>
		<li>I hope to learn how to set up a cool app.</li>
		<li>Designing for a screen is directly affected by the code and how well it is written, thus requiring a good deal of knowledge on such.</li>
		<li>vogue.com is a fashion website that best exemplifies good design. It incorporates simple shapes, elegant typography and central orientation to create a website that is effective to scroll through, explore, etc. It is easy to visually maneuver.</li>
		<li>nytimes.com is the online base for the ney york newpspaper. It mimics the style of real newspapers by sectioning off articles with a bar. It exemplifies hieararchy of information with larger texts and smaller texts, and also includes an image per article to describe that information.</li>
		<li>twitter.com is one of my favorite websites. It is a social platform where users can tweet 180+ characters, images, and videos. They are posted to a timeline that includes tweets from accounts that you follow. Add a hastag and you can find other tweets with the similar keyword. This platform is effective overall because it congrgates pubished statements and shares it together. The tweet is a rectangular bar, with a profile picture, and icons underneath the statement where people can retweet, like, bookmark, and share. This execution includes sharing tools that really show that this website is a social platform.</li>
